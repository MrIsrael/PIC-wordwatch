# WordWatch with PIC 16F886 (spanish)
- **This project contains all designs, files and code to build a DIY LED watch, wall mountable, which displays the time with letters, in spanish.**<br />
Resolution: 5 minutes. The words change each 5 minutes.<br />
You can find an example of how it looks when finished, opening image "Wordwatch finished.jpg".<br />
Entire design was built around PIC 16F886 from Microchip.<br />
Schematic and PCB design made using Autodesk EAGLE 8.0.1.<br />
Assembler code edited and compiled using Microchip MPLAB IDE v8.92.<br />
PICkit 2 was used for .hex transfer to microcontroller.<br />

## Instructions
--> Check the components listed in .sch file.<br />
--> Build the PCB using the PDF prints. There is a great guide to do it yourself, [here] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvNCKwAcg90).<br />
--> Burn the .hex to PIC 16F886, using a PICkit 2 or compatible PIC programmer.<br />
--> Use the "front layout" images to print a scale screen for the leds. I suggest create a wood screen, etching the letters with laser cutter.<br />
--> Use any AC/DC adaptor to power the clock. Minimum output voltage - current required: 6V DC, 300 mA.<br />

## How to set time
--> Once powered on, press the button to enter set mode. Words will start to blink.<br />
--> Press button again to change and set hours.<br />
--> Wait 10 seconds without pressing the button. Now minutes start to blink.<br />
--> Press button to change and set minutes.<br />
--> Wait another 10 seconds without pressing the button. Program will return to normal mode.<br />
